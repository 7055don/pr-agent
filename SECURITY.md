# Security Policy

## Qodo Merge ðŸ’Ž (SaaS)
* When using Qodo MergeðŸ’Ž, hosted by Qodo, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

* For certain clients, Qodo Merge will use Qodoâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

* No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” Qodo Merge will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

## Qodo Merge ðŸ’Ž (Self-hosted)
* If you self-host PR-Agent with your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) API key, it is between you and the provider. We don't send your code data to Qodo servers.

## Qodo Merge Chrome extension

* The Chrome extension will not send your code to any external servers.
* For private repositories, we will first validate the user's identity and permissions. After authentication, we generate responses using the existing Qodo Merge integration.
