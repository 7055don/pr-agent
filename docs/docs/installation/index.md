# Installation

## Self-hosted PR-Agent
If you choose to host your own PR-Agent, you first need to acquire two tokens:

1. An OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys){:target="_blank"}, with access to GPT-4 (or a key for other [language models](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/changing_a_model/), if you prefer).
2. A Git personal access token, with the repo scope (GitHub token can be issued from for example [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens){:target="_blank"})

There are several ways to use self-hosted PR-Agent:

- [Locally](./locally.md)
- [GitHub integration](./github.md)
- [GitLab integration](./gitlab.md)
- [BitBucket integration](./bitbucket.md)
- [Azure DevOps integration](./azure.md)
