# High-level Suggestions ðŸ’Ž

`Supported Git Platforms: GitHub, GitLab (Both cloud & server. For server: Version 17 and above)`

## Overview
High-level Suggestions offer a broad view of the pull request via the improve tool. 
Rather than local code fixes, they may provide examples of what needs improvement as well as before and after code snippets to illustrate necessary changes and guide implementation.
