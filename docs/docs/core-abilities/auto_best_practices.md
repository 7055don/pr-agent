# Auto Best Practices ðŸ’Ž
`Supported Git Platforms: GitHub`

## Overview

### Finding Code Problems - Exploration Phase

The Qodo Merge `improve` tool identifies potential issues, problems and bugs in Pull Request (PR) code changes. 
Rather than focusing on generic concepts like code style, the tool intelligently analyzes code to detect meaningful problems. 

The analysis is intentionally broad to allow discovery of diverse issues - from subtle bugs to architectural concerns. 
This open-ended exploration enables the tool to surface any relevant issues without being constrained to predefined categories.

### Tracking Implemented Suggestions

Qodo Merge features a novel [tracking system](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/improve/#suggestion-tracking) that automatically detects when PR authors implement AI-generated code suggestions. 
All accepted suggestions are documented in a repository-specific wiki page called [`.pr_agent_accepted_suggestions`](https://github.com/qodo-ai/pr-agent/wiki/.pr_agent_accepted_suggestions).

### Learning and Applying Auto Best Practices

Monthly, Qodo Merge analyzes the collection of accepted suggestions to generate repository-specific best practices, stored in [`.pr_agent_auto_best_practices`](https://github.com/qodo-ai/pr-agent/wiki/.pr_agent_auto_best_practices) wiki file.
These best practices reflect recurring patterns in accepted code improvements.

The `improve` tool will incorporate these best practices as an additional analysis layer, checking PR code changes against known patterns of previously accepted improvements.
This creates a two-phase analysis:

1. Open exploration for general code issues
2. Targeted checking against established best practices - exploiting the knowledge gained from past suggestions

By keeping these phases decoupled, the tool remains free to discover new or unseen issues and problems, while also learning from past experiences.

When presenting the suggestions generated by the `improve` tool, Qodo Merge will add a dedicated label for each suggestion generated from the auto best practices - 'Learned Best Practice':

## Auto Best Practices vs Custom Best Practices

Teams and companies can also manually define their own [custom best practices](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/improve/#best-practices) in Qodo Merge to evaluate PR code changes. 

When custom best practices exist, Qodo Merge will still generate an 'auto best practices' wiki file, though it won't use it in the `improve` tool analysis. 
However, this auto-generated file can still serve two valuable purposes:

1. It can help enhance your custom best practices with additional insights derived from suggestions your team found valuable enough to implement
2. It demonstrates effective patterns for writing AI-friendly best practices

We recommend regularly reviewing the auto best practices file to refine your custom rules, even when using custom best practices.

## Relevant configurations

```toml
[auto_best_practices]
# Disable all auto best practices usage or generation
enable_auto_best_practices = true  

# Disable usage of auto best practices file in the 'improve' tool
utilize_auto_best_practices = true 

# Extra instructions to the auto best practices generation prompt
extra_instructions = ""            

# Max number of patterns to be detected
max_patterns = 5                   
```
